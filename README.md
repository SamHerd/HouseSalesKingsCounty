House Sales in King County, USA
Overview

This project analyzes house sales data in King County, USA, to explore the factors influencing house prices and develop predictive models to estimate future house prices. The project involves cleaning and preprocessing the data, exploring relationships between features, and developing regression models to make accurate price predictions. It provides insights into how different property features impact sale prices and identifies the most influential factors.
Features

✅ Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

    Handles missing values, removes outliers, and prepares the data for analysis.

✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

    Uses visualizations to explore trends and relationships between property features and sale price.

✅ Correlation Analysis

    Identifies which features have the strongest impact on house prices.

✅ Regression Modeling

    Builds multiple regression models to predict house prices based on property characteristics.

✅ Model Evaluation

    Evaluates the performance of regression models using metrics like R² and RMSE.
